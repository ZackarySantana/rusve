# Welcome to Rusve!
Do You see what I did there :)?  
### What is Rusve? 
It is a attempt to find the best way to build **fast** and **scalable** web applications, while not beeing afraid of new technologies. And I think we are getting there.

### Currently working on...
1. Deployment on GCP, with files on buckets and emails via pubsub
2. Making the app resiliant to no internet

## Features
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - Hard to learn, but once You do...You will be able to say "I use Rust".
  - **No unnecessary unwrap** - Each error is handled.
  - **No unnecessary cloning** - As performant as it can be.
  - **[Tonic](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/)** - amazing gRPC rust crate, with first class support of async/await. 
  - **Sql Pools and Transactions** - Using the best practice for the best performance and error prone.
  - **Streaming** - Streaming the data directly from postgreSQL.
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - Once You try it, it's hard to go back to any other framework:
  - **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Fully written in typescript with the [strict](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#strict) rules enforced. No any or unknown in code.
  - **[Form actions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions)** - Forms are handled by server, which force You to seperate view and logic. This is a great pattern and makes the logic unaccesible by the browser. 
  - **[Zod validation](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)** - Every data if validated. Errors are returned and used by client to view them on forms.
  - **[Streaming](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#streaming-with-promises)** - Important data is loaded and rendered first, after that all the rest are returned as promises and rendered when they resolve.
  - **[TawilwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Used for styling, no other UI library needed. 
  - **Minimal external libraries** - With Svelte animation and stores builing custom components is very easy. Checkout `Toast`, `Drawer`, `Modal`, `Dropdown` and see for yourself.
- **gRPC** - Fast, streamable and gives You amazing typesafety across the whole project, no matter the language (hi tRPC).
- **Microservices** - Scaling? Different Language? Cost-effecient? Done.
- **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)** - Deployed to Google Cloud Run, great scaling solution for dockerized application. Everything is done via github actions.
- **Dockerized** - Easy do deploy, easy to move, easy to work with. Move to GCP? No problem.
- **[Firebase SSR Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies)** - Secured and safe, battle tested and very easy to work with.
- **Multi language** - You can use any language for backend. Here we use mainly Rust, but there is also a Go service running.
- **Files** - Upload, view and download. Everything ready to use.

In progress:
- **MDX**
- **Stripe**
- **Any other feature You will request :)**

## Application

## Architecture

## Authorization

## Github action deployment
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26543876/235082796-cfc6a48b-4a3b-4633-a713-d19f99507e60.png)


## Dev deployment

1. Client setup
```
cp client/.env.dist client/.env
npm i --prefix client
```

2. Run proto generation
```
sh proto.sh
```

2. Fill in missing firebase secrets in `client/.env`
- PUBLIC_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT

Getting the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` key is a bit [tricky](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments).


3. Start docker:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Bonus: Three ways to shows notes. Not implemented in application, but all the code is there to try it.
This project shows how flexible the gRPC + SvelteKit setup is, using the newest SvelteKit `streamed` feature. There are three ways to display notes:
1. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes -> for each note it calls `users service` for user -> the note with the user is returned as stream
2. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` calls `users service` for user -> not waiting for users to resolve, he dispaly the notes, and after that await users as `streamed` data
3. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` add userId to set -> then, in one request he calls `users service` for all users -> not waiting for users to resolve, he displays notes and after that await users as `streamed` data
