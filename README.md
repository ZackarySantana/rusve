# Welcome to Rusve!

### What is Rusve? 

It is a attempt to find the best way to build **fast** and **scalable** web applications, while not beeing afraid of new technologies. And I think we are getting there.

Feel free to ask questions and throw new ideas! Any contribution is also welcome, especially some ux/ui redesigns :)

### Currently working on...
- **MDX**
- **Any other feature You will request :)**

## Features
- **Backend**
  - **Microservices** - Splitted into smaller parts, very easy to scale, and allows using any combination of languages and databases.
  - **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - Most of the logic written in Rust, hard but amazing language. Almost impossible to write code that will not start.
  - **[Go](https://go.dev/)** - One service written in Go, very easy to learn while still having great performance.
  - **[gRPC](https://grpc.io/)** - Connection between services using gRPC, which is very fast and gives an option for bi-directional streaming. For Rust using great **[Tonic](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/)** create, with first class support of async/await.
  - **[Typesafety](https://protobuf.dev/)** - Thanks to protobuf, amazing typesafety across the whole project, no matter the language (not only for TS, hi tRPC).
  - **Sql Pools and Transactions** - Using the best practice for the best performance and error handling.
  - **Dockerized** - Every service is dockerized. Local build ready with one command.
- **Frontend**
  - **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - Once You try it, it's hard to go back to any other framework.
  - **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Fully written in typescript with the [strict](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#strict) rules enforced. No any or unknown in code.
  - **[Form actions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions)** - Forms are handled by server, which force You to seperate view and logic. This is a great pattern and makes the logic unaccesible by the browser. 
  - **[Zod validation](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)** - Every data if validated. Errors are returned and used by client to view them on forms.
  - **[Streaming](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#streaming-with-promises)** - Important data is loaded and rendered first, after that all the rest are returned as promises and rendered when they resolve.
  - **PWA with service workers** - Turn off the internet and check how resiliant the app is.
  - **[Firebase SSR Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)** - Battle-tested OAuth, Magic Link, Phone Number. And by doint it on Svelte server, it's much more [secure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies).
  - **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Used for styling, no other UI library needed. 
  - **Minimal external libraries** - With Svelte animation and stores builing custom components is very easy. Checkout `Toast`, `Drawer`, `Modal`, `Dropdown` and see for yourself.
- **Deployment**
  - **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)** - Easy to deploy, easy to scale, easy to maintain, and still cheap.
  - **[Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)** - Ready to use github actions for deployment, each service is linted and checked. Possible to deploy all services or a single one.
  - **[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)** - Thanks to dockerized application, it's very easy to deploy. Scaling done automatically, can set the min. instances to 1 to reduce cold start.
  - **[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)** - Working files upload, download and delete.
  - **[PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)** - Asynchronus data sending.
- **Additional features**
  - **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-pl)** - Fully working subscription flow.
  - **[HeadlessCMS](https://directus.io/)** - Headless cms via Directus.
  - **[WYSIWYG](https://tiptap.dev/)** - Wyswig text editor thanks to TipTap.

## Architecture

## Authorization

## Github action deployment
### Release all

### Release single

## Aria and PWA with offline service workers
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26543876/236647026-0db54439-b841-4e69-8a2f-6976e423b453.png)

## Dev deployment

1. Client setup
```
cp client/.env.example client/.env
npm i --prefix client
```

2. Run proto generation
```
sh proto.sh
```

2. Fill in missing firebase secrets in `client/.env`
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT

Getting the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` key is a bit [tricky](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments).


3. Start docker:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Production deployment

1. Go through each `deploy-***.yml` and change `env` acording to Your project.

2. Add secrets to github
- GCP_CREDENTIALS 
- DB_PASS
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT

3. Add proper IAM permissions

## Bonus: Three ways to shows notes. Not implemented in application, but all the code is there to try it.
This project shows how flexible the gRPC + SvelteKit setup is, using the newest SvelteKit `streamed` feature. There are three ways to display notes:
1. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes -> for each note it calls `users service` for user -> the note with the user is returned as stream
2. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` calls `users service` for user -> not waiting for users to resolve, he dispaly the notes, and after that await users as `streamed` data
3. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` add userId to set -> then, in one request he calls `users service` for all users -> not waiting for users to resolve, he displays notes and after that await users as `streamed` data
