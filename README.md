# Welcome to Rusve!
Do You see what I did there :)?  
### What is Rusve? 
It is a attempt to find the best way to build **fast** and **scalable** web applications, while not beeing afraid of new technologies. And I think we are getting there.

### Currently working on...
- Making the app resiliant to no internet
- **MDX**
- **Any other feature You will request :)**

## Features
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - Hard to learn, but once You do...You will be able to say "I use Rust".
  - **No unnecessary unwrap / cloning** - As clean and performant as possible.
  - **[Tonic](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/)** - Amazing gRPC rust crate, with first class support of async/await. 
  - **Sql Pools and Transactions** - Using the best practice for the best performance and error handling.
  - **Streaming** - Streaming the data directly from postgreSQL.
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - Once You try it, it's hard to go back to any other framework:
  - **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Fully written in typescript with the [strict](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#strict) rules enforced. No any or unknown in code.
  - **[Form actions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions)** - Forms are handled by server, which force You to seperate view and logic. This is a great pattern and makes the logic unaccesible by the browser. 
  - **[Zod validation](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)** - Every data if validated. Errors are returned and used by client to view them on forms.
  - **[Streaming](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#streaming-with-promises)** - Important data is loaded and rendered first, after that all the rest are returned as promises and rendered when they resolve.
  - **[TawilwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Used for styling, no other UI library needed. 
  - **Minimal external libraries** - With Svelte animation and stores builing custom components is very easy. Checkout `Toast`, `Drawer`, `Modal`, `Dropdown` and see for yourself.
- **gRPC** - Fast, streamable and gives You amazing typesafety across the whole project, no matter the language (hi tRPC).
- **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)** - Easy to deploy, easy to scale, easy to maintain.
  - **Microservices** - Application splited into smaller parts, deployed using Google Cloud Run. Only client service is open to public and it's server act as a gateway.
  - **Dockerized** - Every service is dockerized. Local build ready with one command.
  - **Github Action** - Deployment using github actions, easch service is linted and checked. Posibilities to deploy all service or choose one.
  - **Google Cloud Storage** - Working files upload, download and delete.
  - **PubSub** - Asynchronus data sending.
- **[Firebase SSR Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies)** - Battle-tested OAuth, Magic Link, Phone Number, and all of that done on the server.
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-pl)** - Fully working subscription flow.
- **Multi language** - Mutli-language for backend. Here, using mainly Rust, with one Go service running.

## Application

## Architecture

## Authorization

## Github action deployment
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26543876/235413947-4e0671b0-a8ca-4d0c-83c8-b7a3a809242e.png)

## Dev deployment

1. Client setup
```
cp client/.env.dist client/.env
npm i --prefix client
```

2. Run proto generation
```
sh proto.sh
```

2. Fill in missing firebase secrets in `client/.env`
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT

Getting the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` key is a bit [tricky](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments).


3. Start docker:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Production deployment

1. Go through each `deploy-***.yml` and change `env` acording to Your project.

2. Add secrets to github
- GCP_CREDENTIALS 
- DB_PASS
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_API_KEY
- PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT

3. Add proper IAM permissions

## Bonus: Three ways to shows notes. Not implemented in application, but all the code is there to try it.
This project shows how flexible the gRPC + SvelteKit setup is, using the newest SvelteKit `streamed` feature. There are three ways to display notes:
1. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes -> for each note it calls `users service` for user -> the note with the user is returned as stream
2. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` calls `users service` for user -> not waiting for users to resolve, he dispaly the notes, and after that await users as `streamed` data
3. `svelte server` calls `notes service` -> `notes service` selects all notes and return them -> for each note `svelte server` add userId to set -> then, in one request he calls `users service` for all users -> not waiting for users to resolve, he displays notes and after that await users as `streamed` data
